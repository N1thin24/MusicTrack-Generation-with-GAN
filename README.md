# MusicTrack-Generation-with-GAN

Overview
The GAN Music Track Generator leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create unique music tracks by parsing existing songs into MIDI format and learning from their structures. This project aims to explore the capabilities of GANs in the field of music generation, enabling the creation of novel music pieces that draw inspiration from a wide range of genres and styles.

Features
Music Generation: Uses GANs to generate music tracks in MIDI format.
MIDI Parsing: Converts existing songs into MIDI format for the GAN to learn from.
Genre Flexibility: Capable of generating music across various genres by training on diverse datasets.

To Improve:
Customizable Output: Allows users to specify parameters such as length, tempo, and genre of the generated music.
User-friendly Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for both training the model and generating music.
